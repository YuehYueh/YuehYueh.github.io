## Steps
1. Press Command+Space, type “Terminal”, and press Enter to launch one. Or, you can open a Finder window and head to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.
2. Run the following command in the Terminal window and provide your password:
   >sudo spctl --master-disable           
3. After you do, head to System Preferences > Security & Privacy. You'll find that the old “Anywhere” option has returned and is enabled.
